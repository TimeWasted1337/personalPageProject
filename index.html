                Recently, I've decided to take on the coding world <strong>FULL FORCE</strong>
                After 15 years of being a professional chef... I'm officially <em>BURNT</em>
                So, I decided I would persue my main love- technology - and how websites and programs
                work on the internet and beyond.  If you made it here, thank you! I hope you enjoy
                my creative mind as it manifests in the world of Development!
                It all started as a young kid watching the food network.  I remember shows like Iron Chef <sup>(the REAL Iron Chef not the American BS it is today),</sup>
                Good Eats, the lot. I thought the food biz was so glorious and would be an awesome way to make some dough. It helped that I have a natural talent for food
                and flavor profiles, so I was able to master techniques rapidly, be it, in culinary school or in the field.  But the reality was, in working kitchens, you end up getting your ass KICKED for a 10-12 hour shift with your head down, making money for someone that dosen't care whether or not you can make your rent.

                 It's not all a shit show though... The people I've met on this journey are some of the best in the biz <sup>(also some of the worst...)</sup>but without
                 most of them this road would have been VERY boring and tedious. To survive in the kitchen is like a game of your favorite "Battle Royale" where the Managers are the Elite Hackers who managed to cheese their way to the top and not get caught out... and the Try Hard type that think they are 
                 the only reason the place opens in the morning.  I've never been one to go on an EGO trip as most chefs tend to do, and I've worked hard to become a
                   successful private chef, working in clients' homes and preparing luxurious meals. I run by the motto "Your House, My Restaurant", making people feel as 
                  if they have left their home for the night and stepped into a fine dining establishment and served a high-end, seven course tasting menu.  But it comes with 
                  a price, as everything does... work/life ratio is WHACK whether you're hustling for yourself, or hustling for an employer.

                Instert Coding, a love at first sight type of deal... it kinda just clicked in some ways and I had to search for anwsers in others.  I started taking classes on Udemy, Freecodecamp, and other sources to absorb as much knowledge as I posibly could.  It's sink or swim, I need this opportunity to succeed and I will see to it that I do!  When no one believed in me (except my Wonderful Family!) I was going to be the thorn in their side to prove otherwise.  I'm worth more than the shoes these wealthy folks wear,  I'm ME, a unique individual with a mind made to think and take this world head on and <big>RISE</big> to my fullest potential!
